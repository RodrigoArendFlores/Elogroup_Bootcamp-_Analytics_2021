# Elogroup_Bootcamp-_Analytics_2021
### Data Cleaning, EDA and Data Visualization with Covid data using Python.
This project is was part of a bootcamp that was carried out by the company Elogroup.

The object of the bootcamp was to enhance the ability to transform data with python.
We used COVID-19 data and the objective was to test a hypothesis about COVID.

It was necessary to clear the data (Data Cleaning) and make coherence test with it. Thereafter, the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was made resulting in Data visualizations and insights.
